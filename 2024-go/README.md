# Rust 2024 Advent of Code

To create a new day: `just gen <#>` for day-01: `just gen 01`

You can set a default day, and part in `.env` and run with `just run`.

Or override them by providing them explicitly:

To run a part: `just run <day#> <part#>` for day-01 part1: `just run 01 1`
To test a part: `just test <day#> <part#>` for day-01 part1: `just test 01 1`
